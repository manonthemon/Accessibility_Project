# Accessibility Project  

## Description

I've completed this project to learn and practice the art of writing accessible HTML and CSS code. 

At the beginning of the project, I was provided with [starter HTML](/original%20files/starter_index.html) and [starter CSS](/original%20files/starter_style.css) files of an example website. I was tasked with refactoring the code in order to improve its accessibility, while maintaining the looks and the functionality of the original example website, as seen here:

Refactoring the provided code allowed me to:

 <li>Learn the basic principles of <strong>accessible web design.</strong> </li>
 <li>Explore the concepts of <strong>semantic HTML.</strong></li>
<li>Better comprehend the <strong>relation between HTML and CSS.</strong></li>
<li>Practice writing descriptive <strong>alt tags for images.</strong></li>
<li>Test my website using a screen reader.</li><br>

## Installation

No installation is required. The front-end of the website can be seen at https://manonthemon.github.io/Accessibility_Project/. The edited HTML, CSS and other files are visible in the repository. 

I also included the original, unedited [starter HTML](/original%20files/starter_index.html) and [starter CSS](/original%20files/starter_style.css) files for comparison.

## Usage

This project can serve those wiling to learn more about accessible web design, as it provides:

<li>Examples of different use cases for a variety of semantic HTML tags.</li>
<li>Examples of consolidated and streamlined HTML and CSS.</li>
<li>Examples of other accessibility-focused features, such as ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes, tabindex etc.</li>
