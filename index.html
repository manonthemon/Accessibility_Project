    <!--TOP IMAGE ACCESSIBILITY UPDATES:
        - Changed tag from <div> to <figure>. 
        - Changed class to id and gave it a semantic name "top-image".
        - I decided the top image is more than a decorative background and conveys meaning and could benefit from an alt tag, which is why I moved it from CSS to HTML.-->

    <figure>
        <img src="../Accessibility_Project/assets/images/digital-marketing-meeting.jpg"
            alt="4 persons business meeting in a modern office" id="top-image">

    <!--MAIN CONTENT ACCESSIBILITY UPDATES:
        - Changed tags from <div> to <section> and <article>. 
        - Changed class="content" to id="main-content-container" for clarity. 
        - Changed image and text classes names for clarity. 
        - Despite there being only one image of "main-image_right" class, I decided to keep it as class, because more such images can be added in the future.   
        - Placed all text present main-content-container in a single main-text class, to consolidate CSS.
