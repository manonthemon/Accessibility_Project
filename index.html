    <figure id="top-image"></figure>

    <!--Changed tags from <div> to <section> and <article>. 
        Changed class="content" to id="main-content-container" for clarity. 
        Changed image and text classes names for the same reason. 
        Despite there being only one image of "main-image_right" class, I decided to keep it as class, because more such images can be added in the future.   
        Placed all text in main-content-container in a single main-text class to consolidate css.
