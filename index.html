    <!--HEAD ACCESSIBILITY UPDATES:
        Changed page title to a more descriptive one-->

<!-- HEADER ACCESSIBILITY UPDATES:
     - Replaced <div> tag with semantic tags such as <nav>. 
     - Gave top menu links a CSS class "top-nav-link" for cleaner code.
     - Changed the CSS id name of the differently colored part of the logotype for one that is easier to understand.

    <header id="main-header">

        <h1>Hori<span id="mark-grey">seo</span>n</h1>

    </header>

    <!--TOP IMAGE ACCESSIBILITY UPDATES:
        - Changed tag from <div> to <section>. 
        - Changed class to id and gave it a semantic name "top-image".
        - I decided the top image is more than a decorative background and conveys meaning and could benefit from an alt tag, which is why I moved it from CSS to HTML.
        - Added role attribute to <section> containing main image to help assistive technology describe it-->

    <section role="img">
        <img id="top-image" src="../Accessibility_Project/assets/images/digital-marketing-meeting.jpg"
            alt="4 creatives meeting in a modern office">
    </section>

    <!--MAIN CONTENT ACCESSIBILITY UPDATES:
        - Changed tags from <div> to <main> and <section>. 
        - Changed class="content" to id="main-content-container" for clarity. 
        - Changed image and text classes names for clarity. 
        - Despite there being only one image of "main-image_right" class, I decided to keep it as class, because more such images can be added in the future.   
        - Placed all text present main-content-container in a single main-text class, to consolidate CSS.
        - Added aria-labelledby attributes to sections to make them recognizable as regions by assistive technologies for improved accessibility.
