    <!--HERO IMAGE ACCESSIBILITY UPDATES:
        - Changed tag from <div> to <section>. 
        - Changed class to id and gave it a semantic name "top-image".
        - I decided the top image is more than a decorative background and conveys meaning and could benefit from an alt tag, which is why I moved it from CSS to HTML.
        - Added role attribute to <section> containing main image to help assistive technology describe it-->

    <section role="img">
        <img id="top-image" src="../Accessibility_Project/assets/images/digital-marketing-meeting.jpg"
            alt="4 creatives meeting in a modern office">
    </section>

    <!--main -->
    <!--MAIN CONTENT ACCESSIBILITY UPDATES:
        - Changed tags from <div> to <main> and <section>.
        - Reduced the number of classes for cleaner code, used compound selectors instead.    
        - Despite there being only one image of "main-image_right" class, I decided to keep it as class, because more such images can be added in the future.   
        - Placed all text present main-content-container in a single main-text class, to consolidate CSS.
        - Added aria-labelledby attributes to sections to make them recognizable as regions by assistive technologies for improved accessibility.

            <h2 id="ORM-title">Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an
                internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives
